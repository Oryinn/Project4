# Project 4
## Report of the Pour

Beers are very fun to learn about, and to drink! So for my project 4 I decided to create an app for users to track what beers they have had and how they felt about them.


Deployed App: https://report-of-the-pour.herokuapp.com/

Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/uVmhjKql/wdi-project-4

The technologies I used for this project:
React, Django, Django-rest-API, requests, and the BreweryDB API.

For version 2 I would like to add some images alongside CSS styling, add authentication with beer tracking for each user, and allow people to directly add beers from the homepage "upcoming beers" list
